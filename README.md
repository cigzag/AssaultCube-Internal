# AssaultCube-Internal
A proof of concept AssaultCube internal cheat created on Fedora 36.

This is purely made as a learning tool to slowly develop into other games, giving me excuses to learn the basics of video game hacking, including working with 3D drawing, Chams, Aimbot, Triggerbot, RCS & ESP. I expect to utilize proper hooking methods and learn the best practises as time goes on, if you are seeing this in it's early days, sorry it looks terrible.
